This is the first event of a series that will drive the attendants to understand the basics and dig into more advanced knowledge of the technologies and instruments that will be useful to approach the Square Kilometre Array data. The event will be fully virtual, and it will consist of lectures, tutorials and practicals spread over 3 hour sessions twice a week for three weeks. The format will allow participation and engagement across different time zones.
