## Introduction to git

In this section you will learn the basics of Git. We will cover all the 
necessary terminology and commands, so that you become a profficient Git user.
**It is important that you follow this introduction if you have not used Git
before!** The following sections will either expand on the concepts first 
introduced here or will make use of them on multiple occasions.

## 1. Version control and Git

First of all we need to explain what version control is. It is a way of keeping 
track of changes to your files. Modern version control systems also provide 
tools that enable code sharing, making working in a collaboration much easier
**and safer**. 

For example, **this is not version control** (extreme example):
![Not a version control](media/not_version_control.png)

- false sense of security - easy to delete important things
- not suitable for collaborations
- impossible to find that right version of algorithm you wrote 3 months ago
- there are tools that make it easy

Git is one of many version control systems available. It is arguably one of the
most popular solutions and is used in a range of projects from academia to
industry. Even though we are here for Git today, you should be aware of other
version control systems that are still in use today (some more popular than 
the others):

| VCS | Quick description |
|---|---|
| CVS | One of the first version control systems. <br>Pretty much dead, but some projects still insist on using it. |
| Mercurial | Fairly similar to Git, but can be considered a bit more limited |
| SVN | _De facto_ VCS in the past. Less popular these days, but some big projects still use it |
| + many more | Visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_version-control_software <br> for an exhaustive list of the version control software from the past and the present

**Why Git?**
- works on Linux, Windows and macOS
- easy to install: all major Linux distributions have relatively new version available (you can always build form the source code if the newest version is required), .exe installer for Windows and an installer for macOS
- uses command line interface (CLI) but GUIs are available
- **you need only a few commands to start**
- works both locally and on remotely
