## Objectives and scope

In this section we will show how to use GitLab to share results with the community or your colleagues. You will be able to share code, text documents, figures or notebooks, which can be rendered automatically.

    Start an account
    Start a repository (Description, README, LICENSE)
    Upload files
    Make changes to file and commit them
    View differences and history
    Share your work!

We will use GitLab, but there are other platforms that offer very similar services and work in almost the same way. We recommend you take a look at GitHub, and BitBucket as perfectly viable alternatives.
